# ✈️ Airlines-wise Flight Cancellation Analysis (2017–2023)

This project analyzes the **number of scheduled flights cancelled by airlines in India** from 2017 to 2023 using official DGCA data.

## Objective

To explore trends and patterns in flight cancellations across major Indian airlines, identify key causes, and visualize insights using Python-based data analysis.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India  
- **Period**: 2017 – 2023  
- **Collected manually** and cleaned for analysis

## Technologies Used

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and presentation

## Key Highlights

- Year-wise and airline-wise cancellation trends
- Visualization of top 5 airlines with highest cancellations
- Comparative analysis of private vs public airline performance
- Cancellation spikes due to operational or external issues

## Insights

- Seasonal peaks in cancellations observed in monsoon months
- Some airlines show consistently higher cancellation rates
- Sudden policy or weather-related disruptions reflected in 2020–21

## Future Work

- Apply **machine learning models** to forecast future cancellations  
- Include **external factors** (weather, strikes, policy changes)  
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** using Plotly or Power BI
